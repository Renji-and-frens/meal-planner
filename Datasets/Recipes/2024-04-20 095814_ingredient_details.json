      "The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per person",
      "For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7)",
      "For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center",
      "Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center",
      "With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border",
      "At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth",
      "For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done",
      "You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball",
      "Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins)",
      "While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the  ricotta and egg into a bowl",
      "Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl",
      "Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point",
      "Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly",
      "Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out",
      "Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so",
      "At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli",
      "Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams",
      "As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air and making sure the two pieces of dough stick",
      "You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking",
      "Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them",
      "If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later",
      "If you don't have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when cooked",
      "To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you know when they're done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes)",
      "Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil, or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for the seafood version"

      "Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve.",
      "Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky.",
      "Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze).",
      "Add sea salt.",
      "Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation.",
      "Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance.",
      "Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier!",
      "You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes.",
      "Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation.",
      "Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour.",
      "Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in.",
      "Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don't recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with!",
      "Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring.",
      "Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand.",
      "When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don't need to use the pan of water.",
      "Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look)",
      "Bake covered/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now.",
      "Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped.",
      "Let bread cool completely before slicing. (if you can wait!)"
